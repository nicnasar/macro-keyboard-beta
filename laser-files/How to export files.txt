I'm having trouble with converting the files from .SVG to .DXF online with the crude files. Because of that, I found that if I export the files in PNG format with a resolution of 26434 by 50000 pixels in Inkscape, and then convert the PNG to DXF, it works perfectly. I don't have any idea on why this happens, but the method works.

The step-by-step guide is this:

1. Download the .SVG files;
2. Open them in Inkscape;
3. Export with the resolution mentioned above;
4. Open any website that does the convertion and change the filetype;
5. Download the files.
